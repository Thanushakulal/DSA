Find the total power used by all the lamps.

### Input Format
- single line containing three space-separated integers $R$, $C$, and $W$.
### Output Format
- output a single integer representing the total power consumed by all the lamps.
### Constraints
- $1 \le R, C \le 10^2$
- $1 \le W \le 10^3$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3 4 5
